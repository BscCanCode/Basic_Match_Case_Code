A beginner experimenting, learning, and applying Python one line at a time. (April 2025)

## About This Project
- This is a simple Python script that takes a number (1–7) as input and returns the corresponding weekday with an ordinal suffix (e.g., 1st is Monday). 
- It was built as part of my Python practice, using the new match-case statement from Python 3.10+.

## Purpose
- Explore the match-case syntax introduced in Python 3.10
- Practice basic input handling and error catching
- Experiment with formatting outputs using ordinals (1st, 2nd, etc.)

## What It Does
-- Asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 7
Uses match-case to map:
1 → 1st is Monday
2 → 2nd is Tuesday
3 → 3rd is Wednesday
4 → 4th is Thursday
5 → 5th is Friday
6 → 6th is Saturday
7 → 7th is Sunday

- Handles invalid input (non-integers or numbers outside the 1–7 range)
- Ends with a message confirming program completion

## What I Learned
- Basics of Python 3.10's match-case
- How to safely handle user input with try-except
- Formatting and combining string outputs
- Structuring simple conditional logic cleanly

##  Updates
✅ Built core logic with match-case
✅ Added basic ordinal suffixes to output
✅ Included error handling for non-integer inputs
⚙️ Will improve logic and structure over time

## Notes
- This README was created with the help of AI tools as part of my learning journey.
- The project is intentionally simple and imperfect — a snapshot of my current progress.
- Will revisit and refactor as I learn more!

## Fun_Fact
- This script was written shortly after I discovered that Python even has a match-case statement — I had no idea case existed in Python until now! 
- This was my first real attempt using it in actual code.
